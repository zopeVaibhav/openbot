/**
 * A headless turn, asserted without a gateway, without a database and without a model.
 *
 * This file exists because `run-turn.ts` RESTATES BY HAND five `ɵ`-prefixed request shapes that
 * `@copilotkit/runtime` does not export. Nothing else in the repository can catch a lock that is
 * acquired and never released, a renew that keeps a different lock alive than the one the cleanup
 * releases, or a `persistedInputMessages` that quietly re-persists a whole transcript — and every one
 * of those is felt by a person rather than by a test: a leaked lock refuses their next browser message
 * with 409 for the whole TTL, so a routine that fails at three in the morning locks them out of their
 * own conversation.
 *
 * So the properties here are the lifecycle ones: cleanup exactly once on every exit path, one run id
 * everywhere, the subtraction, and the order the three platform calls happen in.
