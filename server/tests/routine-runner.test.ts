/**
 * A routine's turn with nobody's browser open, asserted without a database and without a model.
 *
 * The runner is the one place a headless firing does what a browser normally does — record the
 * reply as channel activity — so what is under test is the sequence and the counts: exactly one
 * activity per successful turn, exactly one run row closed, and the fatigue rule speaking once and
 * then shutting up. `runTurn` is injected, which is why nothing here dials a model, and the store
 * halves are recording stubs, which is why nothing here needs Postgres.
 *
 * The person-facing half of RoutineStore throws on contact: the runner acts as the owner but is not
 * the owner asking a question, and reaching for `create` or `listFor` from here would be a bug that
 * a test asserting only outcomes would not see.
