/**
 * Asking a person, as a first-class answer.
 *
 * A Bot that needs judgement has three things it can do: guess, ask another Bot, or ask the person.
 * Only the first two were ever offered, and a model with no named way to stop will take one of them:
 * it guesses confidently, or it hands the work sideways to a Bot that cannot settle it either and
 * spends a run finding that out. The caps in `handoff.ts` then become the only exit from a chain
 * that should never have started.
 *
 * So this is a tool, sitting beside the one for handing work to another Bot and competing with it
 * for the same decision. It ends the Bot's turn by putting the question to whoever this deployment
 * says stands behind the work, and it says who that was, so the Bot can tell the person what it has
 * done rather than falling silent.
 *
 * WHO "A PERSON" IS, IS A SEAM. In this template it is the person in the conversation, which is the
 * only answer a template can give honestly. A company running this has a different one: an on-call
 * rota, a duty desk, a queue somebody works through in the morning. That is a route this deployment
 * hands in, not a channel post written into the tool.
