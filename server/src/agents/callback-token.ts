 * What an agent presents when it calls a tool back, and on whose behalf.

 * Two separate things, because they answer different questions and one cannot answer both.
 *
 * The **token** says which agent is calling. It is issued per agent, held by whoever runs that agent,
 * and stored here only as a hash: we issue it and we only ever need to check one, so keeping the
 * token itself would make a database dump a working credential for every registered agent.
 *
 * The **run assertion** says which Bot and which person the call is for. A token cannot carry that:
 * it is minted once and reused for months, while the answer changes every run. Before this existed,
 * `/api/agent-tools/call` read the Bot and the actor out of the request body, so anything holding the
 * one deployment-wide token could spend any Bot's grants and write any person's name into the audit
 * trail. The trail is the product; a forgeable trail is worse than no trail.
 *
 * The two are checked against each other. An assertion names the Bot it was issued for, and a call is
 * refused unless that Bot is the one the presented token belongs to, so an agent cannot replay an
 * assertion it happened to see and act as somebody else's Bot.
