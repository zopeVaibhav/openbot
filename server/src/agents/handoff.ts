/**
 * One Bot handing work to another.
 *
 * A person can put several Bots in a channel and address them with `@`. What they could not do is
 * let one Bot bring in another: every hop went through a person, who read the answer, decided who
 * should see it next, and pasted it across.
 *
 * THIS IS THE PART THAT DECIDES, not the part that delivers. It resolves who is being addressed,
 * refuses when it should, writes the row that says what happened, and puts a durable hop on the
 * queue. What claims that hop and runs the other Bot is `handoff-runner.ts`, and the split is
 * deliberate: deciding happens inside somebody's run and must be fast and fail closed, while
 * delivering is a whole agent turn that has to survive the pod it started on.
 *
 * EVERY REFUSAL IS AN ANSWER, NOT AN ERROR. The asking Bot is mid-run with a person waiting, so a
 * refusal comes back as a sentence it can say. A thrown error ends the run with nothing said, which
 * reads to the person as the Bot ignoring them.
