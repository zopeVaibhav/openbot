 * The tools a Bot may call, as the runtime's own tool definitions, executed on the server.

 * The loop used to run in the browser: every MCP tool was registered with `useFrontendTool` and its
 * handler posted back to `/api/plugins/call`. That made a browser a hard requirement for a Bot to do
 * anything, which rules out an embedded widget, a run nobody is watching, and any surface that is
 * not our own app.
 *
 * Nothing about governance moves with it. `callTool` is still the only path to a vendor: it checks
 * the grant, evaluates the policy, writes the audit row, and only then calls out. This module hands
 * the model a description of what it may call; the store remains what decides whether a call happens.

 * whether or not it has any connectors at all. The browser prose wins: it is emphatic, it is about
 * capability, and it says "never claim you cannot browse".
 *
 * So a Bot holding four Google Drive tools browsed to drive.google.com, met a sign-in page its
 * container could never satisfy, and asked its person to sign in to a vendor that person had already
 * connected. The tools were there the whole time.
 *
 * Generated from the grants rather than written down, because the point is that it tracks them. An
 * administrator switching a connector on, or granting one more of its tools, changes what the Bot is
 * told on its next run with nothing else to remember and nothing to keep in step.
