/**
 * Running one firing of a routine with nobody's browser open.
 *
 * A turn normally has a person in front of it: their browser runs the agent, sees the reply, and
 * tells the server what was said, which is what moves the channel to the top of their roster and
 * lights the unread dot. A routine has none of that, so this file does that last step itself —
 * `recordActivity` — and it is the only place a headless turn does, which is why there is exactly
 * one of those calls per successful firing here and why the tests count them.
 *
 * TWO LEDGERS, AND THEY ARE NOT THE SAME LEDGER.
 *
 * The queue's attempt count (`server/src/work/queue.ts`) bounds retries of ONE FIRING: a consumer
 * that died mid-turn, a runner that is flapping, a lease that stopped being renewed. It answers
 * "how many times have we handed this one due moment out?".
 *
 * The fatigue rule below counts CONSECUTIVE FIRINGS THAT FAILED, in `routine_runs`, across days.
 * It answers "is this routine still worth firing at all?" — a Notion token that expired in March
 * fails every night, and no number of retries of any one night's firing will fix it.
 *
 * Conflating them is how a broken routine either spams a channel — a per-attempt notification
 * posting three times for one bad night — or retries for ever, because a rule counting attempts
 * within a firing never sees the routine that fails cleanly, once, every single night.
