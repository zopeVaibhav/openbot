/**
 * One headless turn, run into the Intelligence thread the person will open.
 *
 * WRITTEN AGAINST `@copilotkit/runtime` 1.69.0, MIRRORING
 * `node_modules/@copilotkit/runtime/dist/v2/runtime/core/channel-manager.mjs:189-316`
 * (`runCanonicalChannelAgent`, the package's own module-private headless-turn engine) and
 * `dist/v2/runtime/handlers/intelligence/run.mjs:114-127` for `persistedInputMessages`. That engine is
 * not exported, so this is a hand copy of it with one addition — `getOrCreateThread` first — and it
 * has to be re-read against the package whenever the runtime is upgraded.
 *
 * WHY NOT A SECOND MOUNTED HANDLER. A loopback that mounts a second `mountCopilotRuntime` and POSTs
 * to its own run route is viable on identity grounds: `identifyUser` and `identifyActor` are both
 * injectable there (`copilot.ts:915-916`), so a routine's request could assert its owner without a
 * header. It was rejected on information, not on identity. The run route answers at gateway-JOIN
 * rather than at completion (`run.mjs:229-247` returns `{threadId, runId, joinToken, realtime}` as
 * soon as the runner has joined), so a caller learns that a turn STARTED and nothing else: no
 * completion signal, no reply text, and no failure. Recovering either would need a second transport —
 * a websocket back into the gateway — which is strictly more moving parts for strictly less
 * information than driving the runner in-process.
 *
 * WHAT WE ARE REACHING INTO. Five `ɵ`-prefixed methods: `ɵgetRunnerWsUrl` and `ɵgetRunnerAuthToken`
 * (at wiring time, in `index.ts`), and `ɵacquireThreadLock`, `ɵrenewThreadLock`,
 * `ɵcleanupThreadLock` here. They typecheck today and are how the package's own handlers do this, but
 * the `ɵ` prefix is the package saying it may change them without a major. Their request and response
 * interfaces — `AcquireThreadLockRequest`, `RenewThreadLockRequest`, `CleanupThreadLockRequest` — are
 * declared in `dist/v2/runtime/intelligence-platform/client.d.mts:339-367` and are NOT exported from
 * `@copilotkit/runtime/v2`, so the shapes in `IntelligenceLike` below are RESTATED BY HAND. Nothing
 * fails loudly when the package changes them: a renamed field would typecheck against our own
 * restatement and be silently dropped on the wire. That is what the test file is for.
 *
 * THE LOCK LIFECYCLE IS NOW OURS TO KEEP CORRECT. In the browser path the runtime holds the lock and
 * releases it; here we do. A bug in it is not a failed routine, it is a thread the person cannot chat
 * in — see the `finally` block, which is the single most important thing in this file.
 *
 * GATEWAY AVAILABILITY IS NOW ON THE CRON RUN'S CRITICAL PATH. Driving the runner means the turn goes
 * through the Intelligence gateway's Phoenix channel: it can answer `CHANNEL_JOIN_ERROR` or time out
 * joining (`runner/intelligence.mjs:194-229`), and events must be durably acknowledged within
 * `EVENT_DURABILITY_DEADLINE_MS = 60_000` (`intelligence.mjs:16, 505-511`) or the run fails. So a
 * routine firing during an Intelligence incident fails HERE, where a turn that only called the model
 * and never persisted anything would have succeeded. That trade was made deliberately: a reply nobody
 * can find in the channel is not a reply, and the transcript is the whole point of a routine.
 *
 * WHY A SECOND RUNNER INSTANCE IS SAFE. The thread lock is a platform resource, not a process one —
 * `POST /api/threads/:id/lock`, Redis-backed, keyed by thread — so a lock taken by this runner is seen
 * by the runtime's runner and by every other replica. `IntelligenceAgentRunner.threads` is a local
 * fast path (`intelligence.mjs:105`, "Thread already running") and nothing else, which is why the
 * runner is built ONCE at wiring time and reused: one instance per turn would fragment that map, and
 * two concurrent turns on one thread would then race past the local check and collide at the platform
 * lock instead of failing cheaply here.

 * The stored instruction, wrapped in the sentences that tell the turn it IS a firing.

 * FOUND ON A LIVE FIRING, and it recorded `succeeded`. The instruction read "Every run, append the
 * current date and time as a new bulleted list item to the Notion page …" and was sent to the model
 * verbatim as the turn's user message. The model read it as a question about routine MANAGEMENT
 * rather than as work: it called `list_routines`, found a routine that already said exactly that,
 * answered that it was already configured, and appended nothing. Nothing failed, so nothing was
 * reported — a routine telling somebody it is working while doing nothing at all, which is worse than
 * one that breaks.
 *
 * And the model was not being stupid. Instructions are WRITTEN in schedule-speak — "every run",
 * "every 15 minutes", "each morning" — because that is how a person asks for a standing thing, and
 * schedule-shaped prose arriving out of nowhere reads as a request to SET UP a schedule. The most
 * plausible reading of its own routine's text was "check whether this is set up"; it was, so it did
 * nothing, successfully. No wording of the stored instruction fixes that on its own, because the
 * sentence a person writes is the sentence that describes the schedule.
 *
 * So the frame says the three things the instruction cannot say about itself: that this is a
 * scheduled firing happening now, that the work belongs in this turn, and that managing routines is
 * not what was asked. It is PRESENTATION — which is why it lives here and not in the stored row or in
 * {@link TurnRunner}'s signature: the row keeps what the person asked for, and this is how it is put
 * to the model.
 *
 * ONLY THE NEW MESSAGE IS FRAMED, and that matters twice. The framed text is what
 * `persistedInputMessages` writes to the transcript — correctly, since the transcript should show
 * what the turn was actually asked — so it comes back as HISTORY on the next firing. History is
 * converted and seeded exactly as the platform handed it over and nothing re-frames it; a test holds
 * that, because the alternative is a message that grows a fresh paragraph of frame every night.
