# Architecture

OpenBot combines a React app, a Hono API server, PostgreSQL, CopilotKit Intelligence, AG-UI Bot endpoints, and governed browser computers.

`scripts/start.sh` starts PostgreSQL, `agent-computer`, `agent-bot`, `agent-langgraph`, and the supervisor through Docker Compose, then starts `server` and `app` on the host.

The compose file also defines optional SPIRE services. `start.sh` does not start them.

## Runtime flow

1. The app opens a channel or direct Bot session.
2. The server resolves the signed-in actor and selected coworker.
3. CopilotKit runtime sends the turn to the configured AG-UI endpoint.
4. The surface registers available frontend tools: browser tools, MCP tools, and components granted to that Bot.
5. Acting browser/file/MCP calls return to the server for authorization and audit.
6. The server streams results back to the app and Intelligence thread.

## Browser action governance

The computer itself does not decide policy. The server gateway is the action boundary:

1. resolve the target from the server-held snapshot or request subject;
2. evaluate the current action policy;
3. write an audit row for the decision;
4. call the computer only when the decision forwards;
5. write a second audit row if a forwarded action fails.

Policy rules can inspect:

- `tool.name`
- `intent`
- `bot.id`
- `actor.id`
- `page.url`, `page.host`
- `element.ref`, `element.role`, `element.name`, `element.type`
- `key`
- `file.path`, `file.name`, `file.extension`
- `mcp.server`, `mcp.tool`, `mcp.effect`

Rules use CEL expressions plus case-insensitive `contains()` and `matches()`.
Deny rules are evaluated before allow rules. The policy engine fails closed: a
missing or empty policy permits nothing, a broken deny rule denies, and a broken
allow rule does not permit. OpenBot's shipped startup default is explicit:
`deny: []` and `allow: ["true"]`, unless `AGENT_COMPUTER_POLICY` or a saved
administrator policy replaces it. A malformed configured policy stops server
startup.

## Computers

`agent-computer` requires `COMPUTER_TOKEN` and permits only `/health` without it. Docker Compose binds it to `127.0.0.1:4100`.

Compose puts it on a different network from PostgreSQL. A Bot has a shell, and a shell reaches whatever its container reaches, so the database is on a `data` network carrying only itself and `migrate`, and everything else is on `default`. A deployment that runs the API server inside Compose rather than on the host joins it to both, which is the one place the two meet.

With `COMPUTER_SUPERVISOR_URL`, each Bot gets its own computer container, workspace volume, and browser profile. Without it, all Bots share `AGENT_COMPUTER_URL`.

A command on the computer inherits PATH, locale and terminal names, and the proxy variables, not the rest of the process environment. Userinfo is stripped from a proxy URL. `COMPUTER_SHELL_ENV` names anything else a deployment wants passed.

The supervisor exposes only ensure, stop, reset, and list operations. It holds the Docker socket, so do not expose it outside the deployment network: Docker Compose binds it to `127.0.0.1:4500`, and a deployment running the server inside the compose network reaches it as `supervisor:4300` and needs no published port at all. Set `COMPUTER_RUNTIME=runsc` to run computers under gVisor on hosts that support it.

## What started a run

Every audit row records on whose authority an action was taken. A routine asserts its owner, and a
hop between Bots asserts the person who began the conversation, so that column alone cannot say
whether anybody was there when it happened. An interactive run has somebody watching who will notice
a wrong tool call; an unattended one does not, which is the case worth being able to find.

Each row therefore also names what caused it:

| `initiator_kind` | `initiator_id`         | What it means                                          |
| ---------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| `person`         | none                   | Somebody was in the room. The default.                  |
| `deployment`     | none                   | The deployment itself, at start-up or refusing a caller it could not identify. |
| `routine`        | the routine's id       | A schedule fired it, as its owner, with nobody there.   |
| `handoff`        | the Bot that handed on | Another Bot asked for this, on the person's behalf.     |

The Audit screen filters on it, and **Nobody watching** is `routine` and `handoff` together, which is
the question of what ran on somebody's authority while they were away. `deployment` is deliberately
outside that filter: a boundary held at start-up is not work done on anybody's behalf.

`deployment` exists so the column never overclaims. A row that says `person` is a row a person caused,
and the two places that have no person at all, the start-up rows and the two unauthenticated boundary
refusals, say so rather than borrowing the default. A deployment that has never run a routine or a hop
sees `A person` on every row a person made, which is what it was before this existed.

## Human control and secrets

Handovers are audited as control events:

- `computer.help_requested`
- `computer.control_taken`
- `computer.control_released`

While a person controls the browser, Bot actions are refused rather than queued.

Secret entry is separate from chat content. The audit trail records that a secret was requested or supplied and the character count, not the secret value.

## Watching a Bot work

Two surfaces beside the conversation. The screen is the live browser, proxied over a websocket and gated on the same question as every other route about that Bot. The Activity tab is what the Bot did away from the browser: every command with its output and exit code, every file read, write and listing, newest first.

Activity is held in the browser for the open conversation and is gone on reload. It is a window rather than a record; the record is the audit trail, which is server-side, survives restarts, and is what an investigation reads. A saved file contributes its path and size and never its contents, matching the write route, which declines to echo them because a Bot may be saving something it was told in confidence.

## Coworkers and channels

A coworker is a durable Bot profile:

- `agents` stores runtime identity and endpoint/key reference.
- `agent_profiles` stores name, title, role, owner, visibility, and deletion state.
- `agent_preferences` stores per-user roster state.

A channel is a conversation with one coworker and a CopilotKit Intelligence thread mapping. Starting a new channel creates a new thread.

Who may reach one is decided by membership: every channel route resolves the caller in
`channel_memberships` and refuses without a row. `channels.allowed_groups` is declared in the
tenant package and stored, and is not part of that decision — `users.groups` is never populated by
any sign-in path, so a group-based rule has nothing to evaluate. Treat it as a declaration waiting
on group membership from the identity provider, not as a control that is running.

See [coworkers.md](coworkers.md).

## Routines

A routine is a standing instruction, created by asking a Bot in a channel rather than through a form,
that fires on a schedule and posts its reply into that channel as the person who created it.

The sweep that notices a routine is due sits beside the computer culler on one shared mechanism: both
write to `work_items`, one PostgreSQL table claimed with `select ... for update skip locked`, leases
timed on the database's own clock, and an attempt cap. Neither runs as a timer inside the API, because
a timer fires in every replica and each would decide independently that the same firing or the same
suspension is due; the queue is what lets exactly one claim it while every other replica's attempt
collides harmlessly with the same row. See [routines.md](routines.md).

## Components

Components are frontend tools a Bot can call instead of answering only in prose.

Sources:

- compiled React components in `app/src/components/gallery/`;
- sandboxed components authored and published from `/admin/playground`.

Governance:

- compiled components are published when first seen by the app catalogue sync;
- sandboxed components are saved as drafts and become usable only after publish;
- every call asks the server whether the component exists, is published, and is not withheld from the Bot;
- component data functions require a separate per-component grant.

The shipped component data functions read the audit trail: `botActivity` and `recentRefusals`.

## One Bot handing work to another

A Bot can address another Bot, and the addressed one answers for itself rather than the first
relaying text on its behalf.

`message_bot` is offered beside a Bot's granted tools, so which Bots may reach which is an ordinary
grant: `plugin_grants` with a `bot` kind. A Bot granted nobody is offered nothing.

What it takes is typed. The asking model names the task, anything that bounds it and what a good
answer looks like, rather than writing a paragraph. Free text is the commonest way a handoff goes
quietly wrong: the receiving Bot infers the intent, guesses the constraints, and when it guesses
wrong it does not fail, it answers something else confidently.

Four things are decided by the deployment and never by the model:

- **Who is being addressed**, resolved against the roster the asking person may see. A Bot must not
  reach a Bot its person cannot, or this is a way around agent visibility. A Bot that does not exist
  and one that is not theirs to see are refused in the same words, so this cannot enumerate the
  roster.
- **Where the answer lands**, from the signed run assertion. Otherwise a Bot could drop a turn into a
  conversation it was never part of.
- **Who is asking**, stamped from the row this deployment wrote. A Bot able to write its own
  attribution could claim to be another one.
- **How deep the chain is**, also from the assertion, which is what stops A asking B asking C asking
  A for ever.

The second Bot runs as the same person, with its own role and its own grants, so it sees what that
person may see and no more.

**The answer lands in that Bot's own conversation with the person.** Not the conversation that asked,
and this is a property of the platform rather than a choice: an Intelligence thread is owned by
exactly one agent. So the conversation that asked says where the work went, and the one that answers
moves to the top of the roster with an unread mark. The person gets both halves.

What the answering conversation keeps is one line saying who asked and what for, not the envelope.
Those are two texts with two readers: the model needs the task, the constraints and the shape of a
good answer, while a person scrolling needs to know why that Bot suddenly spoke. The asking
conversation's history is read by the addressed Bot as context and is not repeated into the
transcript.

**A hop that fails for good is said out loud.** When one runs out of attempts, the asking Bot is sent
back into the conversation the person is watching to say plainly that nothing came back. Otherwise a
question handed on and never answered is indistinguishable from a slow one, and the conversation just
stops.

**A hop is claimed work, not a callback.** It is a row on the same queue the idle-computer culler
uses: the Bot being addressed is very unlikely to be on the pod that addressed it, and a hop held in
memory is lost the moment either is rescheduled. Every replica sweeps for hops and the queue decides
which gets which. The lease is renewed for as long as the run takes, because a run is minutes and a
lapsed lease hands the same hop to a second replica.

`BOT_HANDOFF_MAX_DEPTH` and `BOT_HANDOFF_MAX_PER_RUN` are the ceilings, and both refuse rather than
truncate. They are not polish: a hop is a whole agent turn at the other end, several Bots asked in one
turn cost several full runs, and where each Bot has its own computer a fan-out wakes a machine per
Bot. `BOT_HANDOFF_MAX_DEPTH=0` switches the capability off, and then no Bot is offered the tool and
the delivery loop does not run.

Every outcome is in the audit trail: offered, refused with which cap or missing grant stopped it,
delivered, failed, and retried. The refused row is the one that matters most, because a hop that
happened is visible in the transcript and one that was refused is invisible everywhere else.

### Asking a person

`ask_person` sits beside `message_bot` and competes with it for the same decision. A Bot that needs
judgement it does not have should stop and ask rather than guess or hand the question sideways to a
Bot that cannot settle it either; a model with no named way to stop takes one of the two it has.

It is offered to every run this deployment builds, whether or not that Bot has been granted anybody.
Reaching a second Bot spends a model call, may wake a computer and can fan out; asking the person
already in the conversation costs nothing and cannot be aimed anywhere they cannot see. A deployment
able to switch off the safe exit and keep the expensive one would be backwards.

Both tools are for Bots that run here. A Bot at its own endpoint runs its own loop and is handed
descriptions of the tools it may call back for, and the callback path executes MCP refs only, so
neither `message_bot` nor `ask_person` can reach it.

It is the Bot **doing the asking** that has to run here. Being handed work is not the same as being
able to hand it on, so the target of a grant may perfectly well live at its own endpoint. A grant
whose *grantee* is remote is refused rather than stored, so an administrator finds out at the point
of granting rather than from a Bot that never hands anything on.

That is a real limit rather than a detail, and it is worth being plain about which Bots it leaves
out: **a Bot created through the UI is a remote one**, because creating a coworker here means
pointing it at an AG-UI endpoint. Only Bots a tenant package declares as built-in run in this
process. So on a deployment with no package, nothing can be granted `message_bot` at all, and the
screens say nothing about why.

Who "a person" is, is a seam. This template answers the person in the conversation, which is the only
answer a template can give honestly; a company has an on-call rota or a duty desk, and that is a
route the deployment hands in rather than a channel post written into the tool. `agent.escalated`
records the question and why it needed a person; `agent.escalation_failed` records one that reached
nobody, which is the row worth finding later.

## MCP and skills

MCP servers and skills share the plugin grant table, but they have different ownership rules.

- MCP tools are admin-governed because they can reach external systems with stored credentials.
- Skills are reusable instructions. A person can create personal skills and attach them only to Bots they own. Administrators create deployment skills.

The curated MCP catalogue contains Google Drive and Notion. Custom MCP servers must pass URL checks; unknown tools and custom-server tools are treated as writes unless positively classified as reads.

A catalogue entry says whose credential a Bot reaches it with, which is a different question from whether it is reachable at all. A deployment-wide token answers the same for everybody; Google Drive and Notion are both `user-oauth`, so a Bot reaches them as the person asking and sees only what that person can see. An administrator enabling the connector and a person connecting their own account are two decisions, and neither can be made for the other. See [Google Drive](plugins/google-drive.md) and [Notion](plugins/notion.md).

Every MCP call checks the grant first, then evaluates the same action policy engine with MCP context, then audits the result.

### Writing a skill in a conversation

A skill can be written from the composer as well as from `/skills`. The deployment ships a skill called `skill-creator` whose instruction is how to interview somebody about the skill they want; a Bot holding it is also offered four tools the app registers — `list_skills`, `read_skill`, `list_skill_tools`, and `save_skill`, which suspends the run on a card showing the command, the title and the whole instruction. Nothing is written until the person presses the button.

The grant is the gate. Those four tools are offered only while the Bot holds `skill-creator`, because four extra tools on every run costs the narrowing above what it exists to buy, and a Bot for looking up transactions has no business drafting skills.

They run in the browser as the signed-in person, through the same `POST /api/plugins/skills` the Skills page uses, so the ownership rules and the audit row are the endpoint's rather than a second copy of them: a person's own slug, an administrator's for the deployment, and a refusal naming the slug otherwise. Written server-side, the tool would have to carry an actor into runs that do not have one — a routine, a Slack thread, a schedule — and the first way that goes wrong is a skill written under the wrong name. Nothing is lost by the restriction, because authoring is an interview and there is nobody to interview where there is no browser.

A saved skill is on no Bot yet. Granting it is the remaining step, and it stays on the Skills page, where a skill somebody wrote can go only on Bots they own.

### Which tools a run is offered

A model picks the right tool reliably out of about ten, and unreliably out of thirty. A deployment that connects two vendors passes that point on its first afternoon, so a Bot holding more than a handful of tools is offered, per run, only the tools of the skills that match the message.

Skills come from two places: a person writes one, or the tenant package ships one in `skills.yaml`. Package skills are seeded on boot as deployment skills, carrying the tool refs they need, which is what lets narrowing work on a fresh clone instead of waiting for somebody to map tools to skills by hand. A slug a person already took stays theirs and the package loses that skill rather than the deployment refusing to start.

A skill declares the tools it needs (`skill_tools`). Before the run starts, the deployment asks its own model which skills the message needs, and the Bot is built with those skills' tools plus every granted tool no skill claims. A declaration grants nothing: the offer is always intersected with what the Bot was already granted, so writing a skill can never hand anybody a tool.

This narrows the offer. It is not a boundary, and it never substitutes for one. The grant, the policy and the audit row decide what may happen; this decides only what the model can see. Every way it can fail — no skills declared, a model that cannot answer, a message that matches nothing, twelve tools or fewer — leaves the whole catalogue offered, because a narrowing that failed closed would remove capability an administrator granted, silently. `mcp.tools_discovered` records what was offered, out of how much, and why.

## Tenant package and knowledge

`TENANT_PACKAGE_DIR` points at the tenant package. The default is `../examples/fintech`.

Required package files:

- `brand.yaml`
- `agents.yaml`
- `channels.yaml`
- `model.yaml`
- `knowledge.yaml`

The server validates the package at startup. Channel agent IDs must match declared agents. Knowledge sources currently support Google Drive and Microsoft OneDrive declarations.

Connector credentials are stored through the credential vault and referenced by id, not stored inline in YAML.

## Security boundaries

- Server routes enforce auth and roles; admin pages are backed by server-side administrator checks.
- Sign-in is Google, Microsoft or Okta from the environment, plus SAML and OpenID Connect providers registered at runtime and routed by email domain. One resolver answers both questions a run asks about a person, whose threads these are and which Bots they may run, so the two can never disagree.
- `INITIAL_ADMIN_EMAILS` is a floor: an address it names is made an administrator at every sign-in and cannot be demoted from the People screen. Everybody else's role is decided there, and every change writes an audit row.
- Registering, changing or removing an identity provider is administrator-only. Better Auth's SSO plugin guards those routes with a session alone, which would let any signed-in person register a provider for a domain.
- A registered identity provider belongs to the deployment, not to whoever registered it. Better Auth scopes its own listing and removal to the registering user and cascades the row from that user, so two administrators see two different deployments and deleting the one who set sign-in up deletes the company's sign-in. Reads and removals go through OpenBot's own administrator-only routes against the whole table.
- A provider's client secret and SAML signing material are encrypted at rest with `KEY_ENCRYPTION_KEY`, through a wrapper on the Better Auth storage adapter, since the plugin stores them as plaintext JSON. OAuth access and refresh tokens use Better Auth's own encryption, keyed on `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET`.
- Signing in, being refused, and being granted the administrator role by configuration each write an audit row. They are the only record that somebody who can edit `INITIAL_ADMIN_EMAILS` promoted themselves, and the only evidence a revoked person was ever here, since revoking them deletes their sessions.
- Removing somebody deletes their sessions and denies their address, because deleting the user row alone is not removal: the next sign-in through the provider recreates it.
- With no identity provider configured, the deployment refuses to start unless `OPENBOT_SINGLE_USER=true` says every request may be one fixed administrator. That flag is the only thing that permits it; `NODE_ENV` does not.
- `KEY_ENCRYPTION_KEY` must be a base64-encoded 32-byte value. The example key is refused with `NODE_ENV=production`.
- Credential plaintext is encrypted at rest, never returned by APIs, and redacted from audit events.
- Browser navigation allows `http` and `https`; cloud metadata addresses are refused under every configuration.
- `AGENT_COMPUTER_ALLOW_PRIVATE_HOSTS=true` is for local development only, and a deployment running with `NODE_ENV=production` refuses to start while it is set.
- Computer tokens and supervisor tokens must be long random values outside local development.
